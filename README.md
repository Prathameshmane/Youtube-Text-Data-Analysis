YouTube Text Data Analysis

This Project contains some of the tweets from Twitter, we need to do specific tweet text cleaning along with normal text pre-processing. A tweet may contain.
1. URL's
2. Mentions
3. Hashtags
4. Emojis
5. Specific words etc.
To clean the tweet, we can use a python library tweet-preprocessor instead of writing the cleaning logic ourselves.
